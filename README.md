# agent-playbooks

> Ansible playbooks for provisioning agent servers — including [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.org/), and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — on ARM64 Ubuntu Server VMs managed by [lume](https://github.com/trycua/lume).

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (macOS — used to install [lume](https://github.com/trycua/lume) via the bundled `Brewfile`)
- An Ubuntu Server ISO downloaded into the repo root. Pick the architecture that matches your host:
  - [Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS — ARM64](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
  - [Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS — x86_64 / amd64](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)

  The Makefile defaults to `./ubuntu-24.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso` — rename the flag to match whichever ISO you downloaded.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a VM

The fastest path is the generic `setup` target — pick a hostname for your new VM and run:

```bash
make setup HOST=my-agent
```

That uses the default sizing (8GB RAM, 110GB disk) and the ISO referenced in the Makefile. To customize memory, disk, or the ISO directly, call the underlying script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-vm.sh "my-agent" \
  --memory "8GB" \
  --disk-size "110GB" \
  --iso "./ubuntu-24.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso"
```

This repo also ships named convenience targets for the maintainer's two hosts — feel free to delete or replace them when forking:

```bash
make setup_rosie     # rosie VM (4GB RAM, 60GB disk)
make setup_athena    # athena VM (8GB RAM, 110GB disk)
```

`scripts/setup-vm.sh` creates the lume VM and boots the Ubuntu installer. The script is idempotent — it skips creation if the VM already exists.

### 2. Install Ansible and dependencies

```bash
make install
```

This runs `brew bundle` (installing `lume` from the `Brewfile`), creates a Python virtualenv, and installs the Ansible collections listed in `collections/requirements.yml`.

### 3. Pick a playbook

Several example playbooks live in `playbooks/` — each one wires a different role chain for a specific agent stack:

| Example | Stack |
|---|---|
| `playbooks/deploy.hermes.example.yml` | debian, security, docker, mise, hermes (Hermes Agent + Honcho) |
| `playbooks/deploy.openclaw.example.yml` | debian, tailscale, mise, openclaw |
| `playbooks/deploy.claude.example.yml` | debian, security, docker, mise, claude (Claude Code) |

Copy whichever fits your use case to `playbooks/deploy.yml` (the file the Make targets actually invoke), and copy `inventory/hosts.example.yml` to `inventory/hosts.yml`:

```bash
cp playbooks/deploy.hermes.example.yml playbooks/deploy.yml
cp inventory/hosts.example.yml inventory/hosts.yml
```

Then:

- In `playbooks/deploy.yml`, change `hosts:` to match the hostname(s) you created in step 1.
- In `inventory/hosts.yml`, replace the example host(s) with your own — set `hostname` / `ansible_host` and rename the per-host vault keys (e.g., `rosie_bot_token` → `<your-host>_bot_token`) to match what you'll define in step 4.

### 4. Create your vault

The `vars/vault.yml` checked into this repo is encrypted with the maintainer's key — forks need their own. Start from a fresh plaintext file and fill in values for whatever your chosen playbook references:

```bash
cat > vars/vault.yml <<'YAML'
---
# Per-host connection info
my_agent_ip: 192.168.x.x

# Per-host Discord bot token (referenced from inventory/hosts.yml)
my_agent_bot_token: REPLACE_ME

# Shared secrets referenced by the playbook's vars block
# (e.g., the hermes example references default_firecrawl_api_key /
# default_firecrawl_base_url — add only what your playbook uses)
default_firecrawl_api_key: REPLACE_ME
default_firecrawl_base_url: https://api.firecrawl.dev
YAML

make encrypt   # prompts for a vault password — remember it
```

To edit later:

```bash
make decrypt
# edit vars/vault.yml
make encrypt
```

> Shared, non-secret defaults (timezone, runtime versions, default user names, ports) live in `vars/common.yml` — usually no edits needed unless you want to override a default.

### 5. Deploy

```bash
make deploy HOST=my-agent
```

### 6. Post-deploy setup

On first deploy, the hermes role generates an SSH key and prints the public key. Add it to the appropriate GitHub account under Settings > SSH and GPG keys.

Then SSH in and complete interactive setup:

```bash
make connect_hermes HOST=my-agent
# Inside the tmux session:
hermes setup          # Authenticate with Nous Portal (OAuth)
hermes model          # Select AI model
hermes memory setup   # Configure Honcho memory backend
```

Start the gateway (systemd service is installed during deploy):

```bash
hermes gateway start
```

Tail the gateway logs:

```bash
hermes-logs
```

### 7. Discord bot setup

Each host needs its own Discord bot. For each host:

**a. Create a Discord application and bot**

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **New Application**. Navigate to **Bot**, give it a username, then scroll to **Privileged Gateway Intents** and enable **Message Content Intent**.

**b. Generate a bot token**

On the **Bot** page, click **Reset Token** and copy it. Store it in `vars/vault.yml` as `<host>_bot_token` (e.g., `rosie_bot_token`), then run `make encrypt`.

**c. Invite the bot to a server**

Navigate to **OAuth2** > **URL Generator**. Select the `bot` scope and enable these permissions:
- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Send Messages in Threads
- Read Message History
- Attach Files
- Add Reactions

Set integration type to **Guild Install**, copy the generated URL, and add the bot to your server.

**d. Deploy and configure**

```bash
make deploy HOST=my-agent
make connect_hermes HOST=my-agent
# Inside the tmux session:
hermes gateway setup   # Configure Discord platform
hermes gateway start
```

## Architecture

A single playbook (`playbooks/deploy.yml`) provisions all hosts with the same role chain:

1. **`debian`** — base packages (including `gh`), SSH server, service user creation, timezone, unattended-upgrades, custom DNS (optional, via `systemd-resolved` split DNS), git config
2. **`security`** — SSH hardening (key-only, no root login), UFW firewall (rate-limited SSH, deny-by-default), fail2ban (24h progressive bans), custom CA certificate management (system trust store + Chromium NSS database)
3. **`docker`** — rootless Docker running under the service user (no docker group escalation), Honcho memory backend via docker-compose
4. **`mise`** — installs runtimes (Node, Python, Go, direnv, just)
5. **`hermes`** — scoped sudoers, Hermes Agent install (official curl installer), Playwright browser install, Discord gateway config, systemd service via `hermes gateway install`, environment file (`.env`) with per-host config, mise/env activation in bashrc, `hermes-logs` helper, and SSH-based GitHub access

Hosts are defined flat in `inventory/hosts.yml` with per-host variables. Shared configuration lives in play-level vars in the playbook. Per-host secrets come from vault. Deploy one host at a time with `--limit`.

### Optional per-host features

Some features are conditionally enabled based on whether the host defines certain variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `custom_ca_certificate_path` | Installs CA cert to system trust store and Chromium NSS database |
| `custom_dns_server` / `custom_dns_domain` | Configures split DNS via `systemd-resolved` |
| `github_token` | Adds `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` to hermes `.env` |
| `home_assistant_url` / `home_assistant_token` | Adds `HASS_URL` and `HASS_TOKEN` to hermes `.env` |
| `discord_bot_token` (+ optional `discord_allowed_users` / `discord_home_channel`) | Adds `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS`, and `DISCORD_HOME_CHANNEL` to hermes `.env` |
| `mattermost_url` / `mattermost_token` (+ optional `mattermost_allowed_users`) | Adds `MATTERMOST_URL`, `MATTERMOST_TOKEN`, and `MATTERMOST_ALLOWED_USERS` to hermes `.env` |
| `git_user_name` / `git_user_email` | Configures git identity for the service user |
